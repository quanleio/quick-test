    <p>The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci (Cenacolo Vinciano) is one of the most famous paintings in the
      world. This artwork was painted between 1494 and 1498 under the government of Ludovico il Moro and
      represents the last "dinner" between Jesus and his disciples. In order to create this unique work,
      Leonardo carried out an exhaustive research creating an infinity of preparatory sketches. Leonardo
      abandons the traditional method of fresco painting, painting the scene "dry" on the wall of the
      refectory. Traces of gold and silver foils have been found which testify to the artist's willingness to
      make the figures in a much more realistic manner, including precious details. After completion, his
      technique and environmental factor had contributed to the eventual deterioration of the fresco, which
      had undergone numerous restorations. The most recent restoration was completed in 1999 where several
      scientific methods were used to restore the original colors as close as possible, and to eliminate
      traces of paint applied in previous attempts to restore the fresco.</p>
    <p>What is the Leonardo's Last Supper nowadays?<br>
      Leonardo's Last Supper is located in its original place, on the wall of the dining room of the former
      Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, exactly in the refectory of the convent and is one of the
      most celebrated and well known artworks in the world.</p>
    <p>Leonardo Da Vinci's "Last Supper", a huge painting of 4.60 meters high and 8.80 meters wide was made
      with tempera and oil on a gypsum preparation instead of the technique commonly used in the fresco
      period.</p>
    <p>Several measures have now been implemented to protect the paint from deterioration. To ensure that the
      fresco is maintained at room temperature, since the last restoration, visitor's' entry has been
      restricted to a group of 25 people every 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>Curiosities about the Leonardo's Last Supper<br>
      Did you know that the great fame of this masterpiece has awaken the interest of many historians,
      researchers and novelists who seek to solve the supposed mysteries and enigmas that surround this
      painting. For example, in the books "The Templar Revelation" by Clive Prince and Lynn Picknett and in
      the novel Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, it is affirmed that the figure to the right of Jesus is not the
      apostle John, but a female figure. The truth is that these mysteries and curiosities have not yet been
      solved.</p>
    <p>Did you know that during the French Revolutionary War Napoleon's troops used the wall of the refectory
      to make target practice and during the Second World War in 1943 the bombings managed to tear off the
      roof of the old Dominican dining room leaving the paint in the open for several years.</p>
